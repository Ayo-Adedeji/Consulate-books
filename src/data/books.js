    description: `About The Book
A story of falling apart, finding courage, and rising again.

When life feels too heavy to hold, hope can seem distant, but recovery begins in the quiet decision to try again. This moving and deeply human book follows the journey of a young man who seemed to have discipline, direction, and a promising future while secretly battling pressures he couldn’t name and emotions he didn’t know how to confront.

His descent is subtle, relatable, and painfully real. His climb back is slow, honest, and full of the small, courageous steps that shape true healing.

More than a story about addiction, this book is a reminder that recovery is not just the removal of a substance—it is the rediscovery of self. It speaks to anyone who has ever felt lost inside their own life, weighed down by silence, exhaustion, or regret.
If you find yourself in these pages, may you also find comfort, clarity, and the possibility of beginning again. A story not of perfection—but of transformation.`,

The Practical Guide for Care and Support Workers in Health and Social Care is a hands-on, good resource for anyone working in frontline care roles.

Each chapter breaks down complex responsibilities into clear, practical guidance that can be applied immediately on the job.

What sets this guide apart is its strong emphasis on person-centred care, professional boundaries, and avoiding common mistakes that can put service users or care workers themselves at risk. Realistic scenarios, reflective questions, and model answers are used throughout to reinforce learning and build confidence. Checklists, step-by-step approaches, and practical frameworks help bridge the gap between policy and practice.

The book also addresses often-overlooked areas such as cultural competence, self-care for care workers, technology in care, documentation, and reflective practice, recognising that high-quality care depends on both skill and sustainability.

Whether you are new to health and social care or an experienced worker looking to sharpen your practice, this guide is designed to improve care quality, reduce errors, and support professional growth. It is equally valuable for care assistants, support workers, senior carers, students, and anyone preparing for training, assessments, or inspections.

    description: `About the book
    Pharmacy Politics in Nigeria reveals the hidden power dynamics shaping pharmaceutical practice, regulation, and health policy in Nigeria—and why pharmacists are often excluded from decision-making. This book goes beyond dispensing and regulation to expose how politics, not expertise, determines leadership appointments, policy outcomes, and professional influence.

Drawing on Nigeria’s health governance history, regulatory structures, and real institutional experience, the book examines key bodies such as the Federal Ministry of Health, NAFDAC, PCN, PSN, and the National Assembly, while contrasting pharmacy’s marginalisation with the political dominance of the Nigerian Medical Association.

Practical and action-oriented, it offers clear pathways for pharmacists to gain political influence through professional leadership, party politics, appointments, legislative advocacy, and strategic networking. It also addresses neglected issues such as donor influence, budget politics, weak enforcement, and the cost of professional neutrality.

Written for pharmacists, students, policymakers, and health leaders, Pharmacy Politics in Nigeria is an essential guide for anyone serious about shaping pharmaceutical policy and healthcare leadership in Nigeria.`,
